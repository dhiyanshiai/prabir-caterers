Banaras ki shadiyan sirf ek karyakram nahi, balki ek parampara hai jo peedhiyon se chali aa rahi hai. A traditional Banarasi wedding is a beautiful blend of ancient rituals, vibrant celebrations, and heartfelt emotions.

The journey begins with the Tilak ceremony, where the groom's family visits the bride's home with gifts and blessings. This is followed by the Mehendi and Sangeet nights, filled with music, dance, and joy.

The wedding day itself starts with the Haldi ceremony, where turmeric paste is applied to both bride and groom for a radiant glow. The Baraat (groom's procession) arrives with dhol beats and shehnai music, creating an atmosphere of celebration.

The Mandap ceremony is the heart of the wedding, where sacred vows are exchanged around the holy fire. The Saat Phere (seven rounds) symbolize seven promises for a lifetime of togetherness.

Food plays a crucial role in Banarasi weddings. From the traditional Kachori-Sabzi breakfast to the elaborate dinner with Dum Aloo, Dal Makhani, and Banarasi sweets, every dish tells a story of our [rich culinary heritage](/wedding-caterer-varanasi).

Modern Banarasi weddings beautifully blend tradition with contemporary elements. While maintaining the essence of rituals, couples now incorporate themes like Ganga Aarti setups, [royal Rajwadi decor](/tent-house-varanasi), and fusion menus.

Planning tip: Start preparations at least 3-4 months in advance. Book your caterer, decorator, and venue early, especially during the wedding season (October to March). Trust experienced vendors who understand Banarasi traditions.
