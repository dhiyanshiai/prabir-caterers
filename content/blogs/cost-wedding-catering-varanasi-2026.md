## What Determines Catering Cost in Varanasi?

### 1. Number of Guests
Large weddings (300–1000 guests) often benefit from economies of scale, but only if planning is precise. Over-estimation leads to food waste and inflated bills.

### 2. Menu Complexity
Banarasi weddings are food-centric. Costs increase with:
*   **Live counters:** (chaat, kebab, dosa)
*   **Sweets prepared on-site**
*   **Multiple cuisines:** (Banarasi + Punjabi + Continental)

### 3. Service Style
*   **Buffet:** Most economical
*   **Live counters:** Adds ₹100–₹300 per plate
*   **Plated service:** Premium staffing cost

### 4. Venue & Accessibility
Catering inside narrow lanes or Katras requires:
*   Manual logistics
*   Smaller vehicles
*   Additional staff

This can slightly increase operational cost.
