Varanasi's Ganga Aarti is one of the most mesmerizing spiritual ceremonies in India. Imagine bringing that divine atmosphere to your wedding! A Ganga Aarti themed wedding creates an unforgettable experience for you and your guests.

### The Concept
This theme captures the essence of the evening Aarti ceremony - the flickering diyas, the spiritual chants, the golden glow of lamps, and the serene atmosphere of devotion and celebration.

### Entrance Decor
Create a grand entrance with traditional brass lamps (diyas) lining the pathway. Use marigold garlands and floating flower arrangements to mimic the Ganga ghats.

### Mandap Design
The centerpiece should resemble a ghat setup with steps, traditional brass urns, and hundreds of diyas. Use warm golden lighting to create that magical evening Aarti glow.

### Lighting is Key
Soft, warm lighting is crucial. Use traditional lamps, lanterns, and LED candles to create a spiritual ambiance. Avoid harsh lights - the goal is to recreate the soft, flickering glow of the Aarti.

### Floral Arrangements
Marigolds are traditional, but you can also use lotus flowers, roses, and jasmine. Create floating flower arrangements in water bowls placed around the venue.

### Music and Atmosphere
Incorporate live shehnai music or recorded Aarti chants softly in the background. The sound should be soothing, not overwhelming.

### Dress Code Suggestion
Encourage guests to wear traditional Indian attire in warm colors - gold, orange, red, and cream - to complement the theme.

### Photo Opportunities
Set up a replica ghat with steps and diyas for stunning photo opportunities. This becomes a memorable backdrop for your wedding photos.
