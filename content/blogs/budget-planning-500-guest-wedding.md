Planning a large wedding can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to budgeting. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you plan a 500+ guest wedding in Varanasi without breaking the bank.

**Catering (40-50% of budget):** For 500 guests, expect ₹1,50,000 - ₹2,50,000 for vegetarian and ₹2,50,000 - ₹4,00,000 for non-vegetarian menus. This includes breakfast, lunch/dinner, and welcome drinks. To get a precise quote, check our [Wedding Catering Packages](/wedding-caterer-varanasi).

**Venue (15-20% of budget):** Varanasi offers various options from traditional pandals to modern banquet halls. Budget ₹50,000 - ₹1,50,000 depending on location and amenities.

**Decoration (15-20% of budget):** Mandap decoration, entrance gates, lighting, and floral arrangements typically cost ₹75,000 - ₹2,00,000. View our [Tent & Decor themes](/tent-house-varanasi) to see what fits your style.

**Photography & Videography (8-10% of budget):** Professional coverage for a large wedding: ₹40,000 - ₹1,00,000. Don't compromise here - these memories last forever.

**Entertainment (5-8% of budget):** Live music, DJ, shehnai players, and dancers: ₹25,000 - ₹75,000. Traditional shehnai is a must for Banarasi weddings.

**Invitations & Printing (2-3% of budget):** For 500 guests, budget ₹15,000 - ₹30,000 for quality invitation cards and printing.

**Miscellaneous (10-15% of budget):** This includes transportation, accommodation for outstation guests, gifts, and unforeseen expenses. Keep ₹50,000 - ₹1,00,000 as buffer.

### Money-Saving Tips
Book during off-season (April-September) for better rates. Opt for package deals - many vendors offer discounts for combined services. Prioritize what matters most to you.

### Negotiation Tips
Get quotes from at least 3-4 vendors. Be upfront about your budget. Ask about package deals and off-season discounts. Build relationships - vendors often give better rates to referred clients.

### Hidden Costs to Watch
Service charges, overtime fees, transportation for equipment, last-minute guest additions. Always ask for a detailed breakdown and clarify what's included.
