Banarasi cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors, aromatic spices, and traditional cooking methods. Here are the top 10 must-have dishes for your wedding menu:

2. **Banarasi Dum Aloo**: Baby potatoes cooked in a rich, creamy gravy with authentic Banarasi spices. This vegetarian delicacy is a crowd favorite at every wedding.

3. **Dal Makhani**: Slow-cooked black lentils in butter and cream, simmered overnight for that perfect texture and taste. A staple that pairs perfectly with naan or rice.

4. **Paneer Lababdar**: Cottage cheese in a velvety tomato-based gravy. The perfect balance of spices makes this dish irresistible.

5. **Laung Lata**: A traditional Banarasi sweet made with khoya and dry fruits, shaped like cloves. The perfect ending to any meal.

6. **Malaiyyo (Seasonal)**: Available only in winter, this ethereal dessert is made from milk foam, saffron, and pistachios. A true Banarasi specialty.

7. **Tamatar Chaat**: A unique Banarasi street food that can be served as an appetizer. Tangy, spicy, and absolutely delicious.
