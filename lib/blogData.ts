            'Banaras ki shadiyan sirf ek karyakram nahi, balki ek parampara hai jo peedhiyon se chali aa rahi hai. A traditional Banarasi wedding is a beautiful blend of ancient rituals, vibrant celebrations, and heartfelt emotions.',

            'Modern Banarasi weddings beautifully blend tradition with contemporary elements. While maintaining the essence of rituals, couples now incorporate themes like Ganga Aarti setups, royal Rajwadi decor, and fusion menus.',
            'Planning tip: Start preparations at least 3-4 months in advance. Book your caterer, decorator, and venue early, especially during the wedding season (October to March). Trust experienced vendors who understand Banarasi traditions.',

            'Choosing the right caterer is one of the most important decisions you\'ll make for your wedding. Food is what guests remember most, and in Varanasi, where culinary traditions run deep, this choice becomes even more crucial.',
            'Experience Matters: Look for caterers with a proven track record. Ask how long they\'ve been in business and how many weddings they\'ve catered. At Prabir Caterers, our 40+ years of experience means we\'ve handled every possible scenario.',
            'Taste Testing is Essential: Never book a caterer without tasting their food first. Schedule a tasting session and try multiple dishes. Pay attention to freshness, flavor, and presentation.',
            'Check Reviews and References: Ask for references from recent clients. Check online reviews on platforms like Justdial and Google. Talk to people who have used their services.',
            'Menu Flexibility: A good caterer should offer customization. Whether you need pure vegetarian, Jain food, or specific regional cuisines, they should accommodate your requirements.',
            'Hygiene and Quality Standards: Visit their kitchen if possible. Check their food handling practices, storage facilities, and staff hygiene. Quality ingredients make all the difference.',
            'Service Staff: Ask about their serving staff. Are they trained? How many staff members will be present? Professional service can elevate the entire dining experience.',
            'Capacity and Scalability: Ensure they can handle your guest count. Some caterers excel at intimate gatherings but struggle with large events. We comfortably cater from 50 to 1500+ guests.',
            'Transparent Pricing: Get detailed quotations. Understand what\'s included and what costs extra. Watch out for hidden charges. A reputable caterer will be upfront about all costs.',
            'Crisis Management: Ask how they handle emergencies. What if the guest count suddenly increases? What\'s their backup plan for equipment failure? Experience shows in crisis handling.',
            'Personal Connection: Finally, trust your instincts. You should feel comfortable with your caterer. They\'re not just vendors; they become part of your celebration. Choose someone who genuinely cares about making your day special.'

            'Varanasi\'s Ganga Aarti is one of the most mesmerizing spiritual ceremonies in India. Imagine bringing that divine atmosphere to your wedding! A Ganga Aarti themed wedding creates an unforgettable experience for you and your guests.',
            'The Concept: This theme captures the essence of the evening Aarti ceremony - the flickering diyas, the spiritual chants, the golden glow of lamps, and the serene atmosphere of devotion and celebration.',
            'Entrance Decor: Create a grand entrance with traditional brass lamps (diyas) lining the pathway. Use marigold garlands and floating flower arrangements to mimic the Ganga ghats.',
            'Mandap Design: The centerpiece should resemble a ghat setup with steps, traditional brass urns, and hundreds of diyas. Use warm golden lighting to create that magical evening Aarti glow.',
            'Lighting is Key: Soft, warm lighting is crucial. Use traditional lamps, lanterns, and LED candles to create a spiritual ambiance. Avoid harsh lights - the goal is to recreate the soft, flickering glow of the Aarti.',
            'Floral Arrangements: Marigolds are traditional, but you can also use lotus flowers, roses, and jasmine. Create floating flower arrangements in water bowls placed around the venue.',
            'Music and Atmosphere: Incorporate live shehnai music or recorded Aarti chants softly in the background. The sound should be soothing, not overwhelming.',
            'Dress Code Suggestion: Encourage guests to wear traditional Indian attire in warm colors - gold, orange, red, and cream - to complement the theme.',
            'Photo Opportunities: Set up a replica ghat with steps and diyas for stunning photo opportunities. This becomes a memorable backdrop for your wedding photos.',
